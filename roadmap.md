# Roadmap for Dev Manager Extension

- [ ] **Dependency Graph Visualization:** A visual representation of the dependency tree for each project, making it easier to identify potential conflicts or circular dependencies.
- [ ] **Security Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate with vulnerability databases to identify and flag vulnerable packages.
- [ ] **License Management:** Display and manage the licenses of installed packages, ensuring compliance with project requirements.
- [ ] **Interactive Dependency Analysis:** Allow users to explore dependencies, view their descriptions, and analyze their usage within the project.
- [ ] **Automated Dependency Updates:** Automatically update dependencies based on user-defined schedules or triggers.
- [ ] **Package Size Analysis:** Show the size of each package and its impact on the overall project size.
- [ ] **Stale Dependency Detection:** Identify dependencies that are no longer actively maintained or have been deprecated.
- [ ] **Customizable Dependency Groups:** Allow users to define custom dependency groups beyond "production" and "development".
- [ ] **Rollback Functionality:** Allow users to easily rollback to previous versions of dependencies.
- [ ] **Task Automation:** Allow users to automate common tasks, such as running tests or building the project, based on dependency changes.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Continuously optimize the extension's performance to ensure it remains responsive and efficient, even with large projects.
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Reporting:** Provide more detailed and actionable error messages to help users troubleshoot issues.
- [ ] **Support for other package managers:** Extend support to other package managers beyond the currently supported ones.
- [ ] **Dependency recommendation:** Recommend dependencies based on the project type and other installed dependencies.
- [ ] **Support for different licensing models:** Allow users to manage dependencies with different licensing models.
- [ ] **Integration with global development goals:** Integrate with global development goals to promote the use of dependencies that contribute to sustainable development.
